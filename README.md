<b> Why we need Blockchain fueled DRM ? </b>
<p>
In today's industry, content creators are not able to get fair share and price of their creation, be it a music, video, ebook or any digital assets. Publisher and Digital distributors are taking hefty amount of profit, leaving pennies for creators. Also all digital assets comes with DRM, which makes asset importable even if user has paid for it.
</p>
<p>
We are aiming to convert whole digital distribution to asset creation into decentralized application, where creators will be paid their fair share and also making content sharing easy for user. We will be using power of blockchain for transparency, immutability of digital asset among creator, publisher & distributor contracts and payments will handled by smart contract, which will be heart of out Dapp.

<p>
All the digital assets we will stored on IPFS which is decentralized distributed data storage platform, where all assets will be stored in encrypted form and smart contract will be used who can access/decrypt this data. This application will have inbuilt ERC20 token which will be used for fueling payment process.
